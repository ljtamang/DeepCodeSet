block: 1 start: 3 end: 5
logical_step_1: Define method cube to calculate the volume of a cube from its given side. Then print the result to the console.
logical_step_details: Call the method cube and assign it to a variable (result) which will store its result. Then print the variable to the console
question_1: What does the following code block do?
answer_1: It declares a static method cube to calculate the volume of a cube.
question_2: What is the return value of the method?
answer_2: The return value type is integer.
question_3: What does keyword static means before a method name?
answer_3: Static means it doesn't require a class object to call the method.

statement: 1  start: 3 end: 3
stm_comment: Create a method called Cube that returns an integer and takes an integer x as a parameter.
//
statement: 1  start: 4 end: 4
stm_comment:  Return the value of x^3.

logical_step_1: Call the method cube to calculate the volume of a cube from its given side. Then print the result in the console.
logical_step_details: Call the method cube and assign it to a variable (result) which will store its result. Then print the variable.
question_1: What does the following code block do?
answer_1: It calculates the output of the method cube(), stores it in a variable (result), and finally prints it.
question_2: What variables are declared?
answer_2: An integer 'result' is declared to store the result returned by the method cube().
question_3: What objects are declared to call the method?
answer_3: Since it's a static method, it doesn't require a class object to call the method cube().
//
statement: 1  start: 8 end: 8
stm_comment: Call the method 'cube' with the parameter x = 5. Store the returned value in a variable called 'result'.
