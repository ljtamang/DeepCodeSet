goalDescription: Program to find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 10.

output: Sum = 55
////
block: 1 start: 4 end: 5
logical_step_1: Declare variables.
logical_step_details: A variable sum of integer type is declared to represent the sum of natural numbers. Also, another variable n of integer type is declared to represent the limit up to which we want to find the sum.
question_1: What does the following block of code do?
answer_1: Declare variables.
question_2: What variables are declared?
answer_2: variables of integer types called sum and n.
question_3: What does the variable n represent?
answer_3: limit up to which we want to find the sum of.

logical_step_2: Find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 10 and print it.
logical_step_details: Here, the value of the sum is 0 initially. Then, the for loop is iterated from i = 1 to 10. In each iteration, i is added to the sum and its value is increased by 1. When the for
loop completes execution, the value of the sum is 55. Finally, the program prints "sum = 55".
question_1: What does the following block of code do?
answer_1: Find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 10 and print it.
question_2: What is the value of sum initially?
answer_2: The value of sum is 0 initially.
question_3: For what values of i is for loop iterated?
answer_3: The for loop is iterated from i = 1 to 10.
question_4: In each iteration, what is added to the sum?
answer_4: In each iteration, the value of i is added to the sum.
question_5: What is the value of sum when for loop complete execution?
answer_5: the value of sum is 55.
question_6: What does program print?
answer_6: sum = 55.

statement: 1 start: 7 end: 7
stm_comment: The for loop stop executing when i becomes 11.
question_1: When does the for loop stop executing ?
answer_1: The for loop stop executing when i becomes 11.
