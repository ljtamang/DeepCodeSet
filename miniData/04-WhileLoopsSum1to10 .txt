topics: while loops
subtopics: loop with simple loop variable increment
goalDescription: Find the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 10.
source: NA
output: 55
////
block: 1 start: 4 end: 4
logical_step_1: Declare and initialize variables needed. 
logical_step_details: The sum variable will hold the total sum that will be calcualted . Variable i is a loop variable that will iterate over all values from 1 to 10.
question_1: What does the following block of code do?
answer_1: Declare and initialize variables needed.
question_2: What is the type and initial value of the sum variable?
answer_2: The sum variable is of type integer and its initial value is 0.
question_3: What is the type and initial value of the i variable?
answer_3: The i variable is of type integer and is being initialized to value 1.
////
block: 2 start: 6 end: 9
logical_step_step_2: Add all the values from 1 to 10 using a loop.
logical_step_details: the loop variable i scans all values from 1 to 10. Variable sum is updated at each iteration with the current value of variable i.
question_1: What does the following code do?
answer_1: Sum all the values from 1 to 10.
question_2: What is the value of the sum before the loop starts?
answer_2: The value of sum before the loop starts is zero.
question_3: By what amount is the loop variable i incremented in each iteration? 
answer_3: The loop variable i is incremented by a value of 1 at each iteration.
question_4: When does the loop end? 
answer_4: The loop ends when the variable i reaches 1000.
//
statement: 1 start: 10 end: 10
stm_comment: The loop variable i is being incremented which is important in order for the loop condition to change.
question_1: Why is the following statement important for the loop?
answer_1: The loop variable i is being incremented which is important in order for the loop condition to change and eventually for the loop to end.
////
block: 3 start: 13 end: 13
logical_step_3: print the total sum calculated.
logical_step_details: Print the sum variable which contains the total sum calculated.
question_1: What does the following code do?
answer_1: print the total sum calcualted in the sum variable.
question_2: How do you call the part in double quotes in the System.out.println method call? 
answer_2: The part in double quotes is a string.
