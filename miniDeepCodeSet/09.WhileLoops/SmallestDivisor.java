         * program_model_question: Can you explain in detail how the goal of the current block of code is actually implemented?
         * logical_step_details: A while loop is used to generate potential divisor candidates from 2 to the number itself. At each iteration, the divisor's value is incremented by 1 so that the next value is tested. The while loop ends when the remainder of the division between num and divisor is zero, which means the value of divisor is the smallest divisor of num. The "Smallest divisor of 15 is 3" is printed.
         * question_1: How are potential divisor values generated and what is the range of candidate values?
         * answer_1: A while loop is used to generate potential divisor candidates from 2 to the number itself.
         * question_2: What happens to variable divisor at each iteration?
         * answer_2: At each iteration, the divisor's value is incremented by 1 so that the next value is tested.
         * question_3: When does the while loop end?
         * answer_3: The while loop ends when the remainder of the division between num and divisor is zero, which means the value of divisor is the smallest divisor of num.
