         * logical_step_details: An expression is defined using a ternary logical operator to check whether the year is a leap year. Because the expression evaluates to true for the year 2020, the string value "Leap Year" is assigned to the string variable leapYear. Therefore, the program prints to the standard output device the message "Leap Year".

         * answer_1: An expression is defined using a ternary logical operator to check whether the year is a leap year.
         * question_2: Does the expression evaluate to true for the year 2020?
         * answer_2: Yes, the expression evaluates to true.
         * question_3: What value will be assigned to the variable leapYear given that 2020 is a leap year?
         * answer_3: The string value "Leap Year" is assigned to the string variable leapYear.
         * question_4: What does the program print to the standard output device, i.e., the computer display or screen?
