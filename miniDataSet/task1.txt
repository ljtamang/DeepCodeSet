block: 2 start: 8 end: 10
Declare a variable called k and store the value after the multiplication of variable i and j and calcualte the result using division and modolus operation and print the result. Result is calcualted by dividing the variable k by 7 and calculating the modulus 2 of it. The output of the program is 0.
